A powerful, TUI-based (Text User Interface) shell script for managing and sending Wake-On-LAN (WOL) magic packets to devices on your network. Built with `bash` and `whiptail` for a user-friendly experience right in your terminal.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Interactive TUI Menu:** Easy navigation and operation powered by `whiptail`.
*   **Network Scanning:** Discovers potential WOL targets on a selected network interface using `netdiscover`.
*   **Target Management:** Save, delete, and manage a persistent list of WOL targets.
*   **üè∑Ô∏è Nicknames:** Assign custom nicknames to your saved devices for easy identification.
*   **üöÄ Dual-Method Wake-Up:** Uses both `etherwake` and `wakeonlan` to maximize compatibility and success rate.
*   **üì¶ Automatic Dependency Installation:** Checks for required packages and attempts to install them automatically.
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Root/Sudo Enforcement:** Automatically prompts for and re-runs with `sudo` if not run as root.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Compatibility

This script is designed for Debian-based Linux distributions that use the `apt` package manager. It is known to be compatible with:

*   Debian
*   Ubuntu (and flavors like Kubuntu, Xubuntu)
*   Linux Mint
*   ...and other Debian derivatives.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies

The script relies on a few command-line tools to function correctly. It will automatically check if they are installed and attempt to install them for you using `sudo apt install`.

*   `whiptail` (usually pre-installed or available in the `newt-tui` package)
*   `ethtool`
*   `etherwake`
*   `netdiscover`
*   `wakeonlan`

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LINUX-OASIS/NETWORKING-WAKE-ON-LAN.git
    cd NETWORKING-WAKE-ON-LAN
    ```

2.  **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x custom-NETWORKING-WAKE-ON-LAN
    ```

3.  **Run the script with root privileges:**
    The script requires root access for network scanning and sending WOL packets. It will attempt to re-launch itself with `sudo` if needed.
    ```bash
    sudo ./custom-NETWORKING-WAKE-ON-LAN
    ```

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Configuration

Saved WOL targets are stored in a plain text file located at:
`/bin/CUSTOM-WAKE-ON-LAN-TARGETS/WAKE-ON-LAN-TARGETS.txt`

Each line in the file represents a target in the format:
`<INTERFACE> <MAC_ADDRESS> <IP_ADDRESS> :: <NICKNAME>`

> **Note:** Storing configuration data in `/bin` is non-standard. This may be changed in future versions to a more appropriate location like `/etc/` or a user's home directory to better follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).
